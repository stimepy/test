#Class: X1LadderT2  (Version 1.0.0)   
#implements: X1Eventmods
#What and why: This is a TWL inspired ladder event.  Ladder is defined as follows:
Teams are put in to postions, each position is a "rung"   Teams can only challenge up a % of the "rung".  Points won mean nothing, only positions matters.  (there are no ties!)
Winning a match means:
If you were challenged: Nothing, you defended your spot on the ladder and will keep it as a reward.
If you were challenger: You move up to the challenged teams spot.
Losing a match means:
If you were challenged: You will be knocked down a to the winners rung + 1 (default) or as many spots as defined by the ladder admin.
If you were challenger: Nothing, your stuck in your rung, moving neither up nor down.

Compadability for XTS Version: 2.6.4
